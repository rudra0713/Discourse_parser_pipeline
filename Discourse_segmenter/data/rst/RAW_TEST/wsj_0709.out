90% of our society disagree allowing Junk foods to schools because of its bad effects on the health of students. Junk food will always be unhealthy no matter how much you reduce the harmful ingredients. Most junk food that are done in a bit of minutes are mostly fried in oil or tossed and mixed with some harmful ingredients like sodium, salt and sugar. These ingredients is formed to keep junk food a long shelf life. Junk food pushes the person to reduce physical activity in the day and age and it leads to one of the main effects of fast food which is obesity. Schools are doing their best to ban these foods for the health and safety of our children. Students spend most of their times in schools so if we prevent them from eating junk food they will turn away and think well for their better life and future. The minute he or she has a snack of junk food, the person gets a spike of energy making him overactive and hyper. Could we force students to eat junk food? It will distract their focusing in school and will leads them to addict junk food and prefer it more than homemade food.
